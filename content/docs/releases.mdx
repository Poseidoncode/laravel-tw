# Release Notes

## Versioning Scheme

Laravel and its other first-party packages follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Major framework releases are released every year (~Q1), while minor and patch releases may be released as often as every week. Minor and patch releases should never contain breaking changes.

## Laravel 12

Laravel 12 continues the improvements made in Laravel 11.x by updating upstream dependencies and introducing new starter kits for React, Vue, and Livewire.

### New Application Starter Kits

Laravel 12 introduces new application starter kits for React, Vue, and Livewire. The React and Vue starter kits utilize Inertia 2, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind, while the Livewire starter kits utilize the Tailwind-based Flux UI component library and Laravel Volt.
